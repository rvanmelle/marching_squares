# Marching Squares for Contours

Swift implementation of Marching Square algorithm for drawing contours. The current implementation only provides support
for triangle meshes. To use the triangle mesh implementation with a set of elevation points, you should first go through a
Delauney triangulation. The resulting triangles should contain elevation points at every vertex. The resulting triangles can be
used to generate iso lines.

## Examples

## Getting Started

## Implementation

Roughly based on the algorithm description in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares).
